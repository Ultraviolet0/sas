## PHP/MySQL Project

This is a basic PHP project that connects to a MySQL database using credentials stored in a secure, non-tracked file.

## Requirements

- PHP 7.4+
- MySQL 5.7+
- Web server (e.g., Apache, Nginx)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name
```
2. Create a db_credentials.php file:
Inside the `private/` folder (create it if it doesn't exist), create a file named
db_credentials.php with the following content:
```php
<?php
define("DBSERVER", "");
define("DBUSER", "");
define("DBPASS", "");
define("DBNAME", "");
```
Fill in the appropriate values for your MySQL setup.

3. Protect your credentials:
Make sure `db_credentials.php` is listed in your `.gitignore` file so it is not committed to version control: `/private/db_credentials.php`

## Usage

The program is written so the `initialize.php` will always include the `db_credentials.php` file.

## Security Note

Never commit `db_credentials.php` to version control. Use `.gitignore` to prevent accidental exposure of sensitive credentials.
